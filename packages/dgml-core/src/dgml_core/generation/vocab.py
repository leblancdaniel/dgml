"""The authoritative tag vocabulary a labeling run resolves against.

One primitive answers the two questions a user-supplied schema raises:
*is this model-emitted string one of the user's tags*, and *what is its
authoritative spelling*. :meth:`TagVocab.resolve` answers both, and its
``closed`` flag decides what happens when the answer is no — reject the
concept (the block renders untagged) or fall back to the model-output
sanitizer that has always run here.

Naming: this is **not** ``extraction_schema.Vocabulary``, which is the
unrelated typed record shape for selective field extraction.
